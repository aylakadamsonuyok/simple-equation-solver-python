# Simple Python Equation Solver

This repository contains a basic Python script that solves simple equations of the form `x + a = b` or `x - a = b`. The script takes user input for the equation and calculates the value of `x`.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a simple equation (e.g., `x + 5 = 10`).
2. The user provides the right-hand side value of the equation (e.g., `10`).
3. The script parses the input, identifies the operator (`+` or `-`), and calculates the value of `x`.

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example interaction:

f>>> x + 5
=>>> 10
x = 5

## Features

Supports simple equations with addition or subtraction.

Handles basic error checking for invalid input.


## Limitations

Only supports single-digit coefficients and constants for now.

Does not handle multiplication, division, or more complex equations.
